# System Requirements
ProfileCreator requires macOS 10.12 or newer.

# Development
The ProfileCreator app is not currently under active development.  All are welcome to contribute to it, however the original developer has moved on from the project.  As such, any feature enhancements and/or bug fixes to the app itself are stalled. 

However, the [ProfileManifests](https://github.com/ProfileCreator/ProfileManifests) project which supplies ProfileCreator with its payloads is very much active!
