## ProfileCreator Wiki

Remeber that the ProfileCreator [wiki](https://github.com/erikberglund/ProfileCreator/wiki) is continuously updated with information about the application and the included payloats.

## New Features

### Import Multiple Files

You can now select multiple files when importing to a file view that supports multiple payloads. Each file will then create a new payload.

Useful for adding multiple fonts or certificates.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue where importing existing profile or paylosd on 10.14 would crash the app.
- Fixed issue where exporting profiles in the XML content style, or with multiple payloads. The exported file would only include one payload.
